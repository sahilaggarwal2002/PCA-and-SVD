# PCA-and-SVD (Implementation in python)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is the most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models. Moreover, PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix is a factorization of that matrix into three matrices. It has some interesting algebraic properties and conveys important geometrical and theoretical insights about linear transformations. It also has some important applications in data science. In this article, I will try to explain the mathematical intuition behind SVD and its geometrical meaning.
